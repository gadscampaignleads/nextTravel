                        <p>We understand that travel plans might change due to some unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, at Traveloways we make the cancellation process as smooth and transparent as possible. Go through our comprehensive cancellation policy below and understand your available options and responsibilities when canceling a booking.</p>
                        <h4>How to Cancel a Booking</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can cancel your booking directly through the Traveloways account or by contacting our customer service team.</li>
                            <li>To initiate a cancellation, you are required to provide your booking reference number and other relevant details.</li>
                            <li>Cancellation requests must be submitted within the timeframe specified by the service provider (e.g., airline, hotel, or activity operator).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Cancellation Fees and Refunds
                        </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cancellation Fees: Depending on the terms and conditions of the service provider, cancellation fees may apply. These fees vary based on the type of booking, the time of cancellation, and the provider’s policies.</li>
                            <li>Refund Eligibility: Not all bookings are refundable. Some bookings, especially discount or promotional ones, may be non-refundable. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed according to the provider’s policy.</li>
                            <li>Refund Processing Time: If your booking is eligible for a refund, it may take up to 7 business days for the amount to reflect in your account, depending on your payment method and bank processing times.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Partial Cancellations</h4>
                        <p>If you cancel only part of your booking (e.g., one passenger in a multi-person reservation or one night of a multi-night stay), a partial refund may apply. The refund amount will depend on the provider’s policy and the specifics of your booking.
                        </p>
                        <h4>No-Show Policy
                        </h4>
                        <p>If you fail to show up for your booking without prior cancellation, no refund will be provided. Additionally, you may be charged the full amount of the booking as per the provider’s terms.</p>
                        <h4>Changes to Bookings</h4>
                        <p>If you wish to modify your booking for example change dates or services, please contact our customer service team. Note that changes may be subject to additional fees or price differences, depending on the provider’s policy.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Service Provider Policies
                        </h4>
                        <p>Traveloways acts as an intermediary between you and the service providers. The cancellation terms, refund eligibility, and fees are mainly governed by the policies of the respective providers (e.g., airlines, hotels, or activity operators). We recommend reviewing these policies carefully before making a booking.
